        "The Learning Paradigm (as opposed to the Instruction Paradigm) emphasises students' active participation in learning as well as the purpose of that learning, both of which can be powerful motivators for students.

        "###What is classification in machine learning?\n",
        "Classification is a predictive modelling task in machine learning where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. The following are some examples of classification issues: Determine whether or not a given example is spam. Determine which of the known characters a handwritten character belongs to.\n",
        "\n",
        "###What are the advantages of different classification algorithms?\n",
        "Overfitting is not a problem for this performer because he is not influenced by outliers. Not suitable for non-linear problems, and not the greatest option for problems with a large number of features. High performance on non-linear problems, not influenced by outliers, and not overfitting sensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "###How is classification used in machine learning?\n",
        "A simple majority vote of each point's k nearest neighbours is used to classify it. It's supervised and uses a collection of identified points to label other points. It looks at the labelled points closest to the new point, usually known as its nearest neighbours, to label it.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Why is classification important in machine learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability to recognise items and categorise them is a typical task for machine learning systems. This is known as classification, and it allows us to categorise large amounts of data into discrete values, such as 0/1, True/False, or a pre-defined output label class.\n",

        "###What is the purpose of a classifier?\n",
        "\n",
        "A classifier is a machine learning method used in data science to assign a class label to a data input. An image recognition classifier, for example, can be used to label a picture (e.g., \"vehicle,\" \"truck,\" or \"human\").\n",
